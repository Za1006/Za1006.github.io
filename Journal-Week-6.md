Journal Week 6

Last week we paired up and change partners everyday to work on projects in Objective C. It was a new language for most of us, and we struggled a little bit. Maybe because of the learning of Swift for the past few weeks, I felt that it had prepared me with a programer mindset, so when Objective C was introduce wasn't as dramatic as I thought it was going to be.

The pair-up, I've learned how others are prepared for assignments and their thought process through out. Everyone works differently with different personalities, and it was a good opportunity to working with others. Because we were all working on the same project, having others collaboration was very helpful, things that I didn't quite understand was explained again with a different light and prospective. We plan and do as much as we can durning the time we are in TIY, and utilized GitHub and Slack quite a bit after we left the building. Because of that, we commit more on GitHub desktop to make sure we can see each others work. I enjoyed working with a partner where both of us can contribute and learn; I think it will also help with on how to plan the project accordingly as well. We tend to jump from places to places when working on our own; with a partner, we know we need to plan things our better and share as much of the work load as we can in whatever ways we can. I think when it comes to a project that is more personal, would be better working as solitary just to reduce the amount of friction that may happend between peers.

Objective C may not be as terrible as I thought it was going to be, but there are a whole lot more typing that is for sure. When using a Swift project to compare on how to code in Objective C also helped me understanding both languages more while working on the assignments.
