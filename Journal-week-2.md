Week three of TIY Orlando has come to an end, felt like time just flew by right before me even though I've started to countdown the weeks already. Doing the countdown actually makes me nervous a bit..., I believe week 9 is when we start to working on our final project. With holidays coming in the mix, time is just going to come closer and closer.

I am not yet comfortable at all to make app from scratch but I do find my understanding of the process of coding better each week and each day. Programming is a very detailed work, you have to become someone who can see things from others perspective of how you would approach the work that you're ask to do, to make your app user friendly. User friendly is huge for Apple, and that is why I am one of their customers, and hope soon to be developer.

Thought about what I want to do with my final project...there are so many directions and ideas but it always comes back to the goal of helping others. I've had a lot of help and from family(my sweet mom), boyfriend, and friends since I've decided to start this coding bootcamp journey. My experience of finding the resources to make this a reality was a very difficult and discourage one. Even after being elated from the miracle of free tuition, I then had to think about how the heck am I going to make everything work without any income?? Lack of better word, the struggle is real! I've shared my thoughts with everyone in class before about the daily worries. The government is endorsing and encouraging everyone especially minorities and women to get into the STEM and programing but there isn't really any other kind of support out there to make it happen for those who cannot dish out or get a loan for 12k-18k, unless you are attending traditional universities and colleges. In my opinion, this method of education is way more effective than studying for four years and more and still end up brewing coffee at Starbucks after you graduate. And that leads to not being able to pay off your student loan, getting into debt and all kinds of other problems that follow.

If I can develop a tech based non-profit company to not only provide those resources to people, help them to find the funds, and during boot camp to provide some kind of assistance to make the learning process smoother. And after they graduate and move on to the world they can give back to the organization by volunteering their time or money to help others who are looking for the same thing. I am not sure how this is going to work but I am doing research and maybe along the way I will find the way to lay this out. There are so many good things we can do with the knowledge that we are learning here in TIY, like I've said many times before this is one of the best life experience for me so far.
