Welcome to the Za1006.github.io wiki!

Two different mindsets and characteristics:
Fixed Midset (Fixed theory of intelligent)
* Believes their basic abilities, talents,and intelligence are fixed traits.
* Believes success is base on innate ability
* Seeing failure as negative on their basic ability
Growth Mindset (Incremental theory of intelligent)
* Understand that their talents and abilities and develop through effort, handwork and training
* Likely to working hard despite setbacks
* Realize their performance can be improved and learning comes from failure

Coming from mostly Asian background, there's this fixed mindset embedded in all of us.You are who you are either going by your zodiac signs or your pass life. I never really believed in or dwell on those traditional thinking as much, but at times I can't help to lean towards the fixed mindset when life is just getting too tough just to find an excuse to give-up. I also believe that we are all here on this earth to learn and to experience, either good or bad things in life will add on character and hopefully incorporate all things to become successful or happy whatever the goal may be.

With the understanding of these two different mindsets, it will help me to keep myself on the "growth mindset" track much better than the "fixed mindset". I believe this is one of the toughest thing I will ever have to learn in my life time, but it will also strengthen me as a person in so many ways. By being here along has already proven to myself that the growth mindset is currently wining!
